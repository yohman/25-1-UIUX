# UI/UX Design Course Overview (14 Weeks)

**Course Purpose:**  
This course is structured to guide you through **core UI/UX theories and practices** while simultaneously **building a functional deliverable**—an application, website, or interactive product. By the end of this program, you will **demonstrate** your final project in front of peers, highlighting the design process, key UI/UX considerations, and lessons learned. Throughout the 14 weeks, we’ll use **iterative design**, **prototyping tools** (such as Figma), and **user testing** to ensure your product meets real user needs and exemplifies strong design principles.

## Week 1: Introduction to UI and UX Design
**Objective:** Understand the purpose of design and distinguish between UI and UX. Begin exploring final project ideas (website/app).

### Pre-Class
- **Read**: Basic UI/UX articles or textbook chapters.  
- **Reflect**: Note personal experiences with good and poor design.

### In-Class
1. **Icebreaker**: Redesign a common object—in this case, a **computer mouse**.
   - In small groups, discuss how you can improve a standard mouse design from both a usability and aesthetic standpoint.
   - Consider elements such as:
     - Button placement  
     - Ergonomics  
     - Visual design cues  
     - Additional features or gesture
2. **Lecture**: Definitions and differences between UI and UX, overview of course project expectations.
   - **UI (User Interface)**: The visual layout, buttons, and interactive elements.
   - **UX (User Experience)**: The overall feeling and journey a user has while interacting with a product, including ease of use, satisfaction, and workflow.

3. **Project Introduction**:
   - Present possible project themes (e.g., interactive map, e-commerce site, learning platform).
   - Students form teams or choose individual projects.
   - Brainstorm initial ideas on the problem space or features they plan to address for their **final deliverable**.

### Post-Class
- **Assignment**:
  1. **Identify two examples of good and poor UI/UX** (include screenshots or links, if possible) and post a short reflection in the class forum.
  2. **Project Proposal**: Submit a one-page proposal for your website/app concept, including:
     - An initial problem statement
     - Potential features or unique value propositions

## Week 2: Understanding Human Cognitive Characteristics
**Objective:** Delve into how human cognition affects design choices. By understanding the limits of memory, attention, and cognitive load, students will learn to create more intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. Begin persona creation to ground your design decisions in real (or hypothetical) user behaviors and needs.

### What Are Human Cognitive Characteristics?
In UI/UX design, **human cognitive characteristics** refer to how people perceive, process, and retain information. Designers who understand these can create products that align with how the mind naturally works. Key principles include:

1. **Limited Working Memory**  
   - **Example**: People can typically hold about 4–7 items in their short-term memory at once. If an app screen has too many action items or requires complex recall (e.g., multiple steps or codes), it overwhelms the user.  
   - **Design Tip**: Use **progressive disclosure**—show information only when necessary and break tasks into smaller steps so users aren’t overloaded.

2. **Cognitive Load**  
   - **Example**: An e-commerce checkout page that asks for unnecessary information or features cluttered design elements significantly increases cognitive load, making users more likely to abandon their cart.  
   - **Design Tip**: Remove unnecessary elements and keep the interface clean. Each screen should have a primary goal or focus to reduce mental effort.

3. **Attention and Focus**  
   - **Example**: A mobile app that sends too many notifications or pop-ups can fragment the user’s attention and cause frustration or confusion.  
   - **Design Tip**: Clearly prioritize content and visual hierarchy. Use color, size, and spacing to guide the user’s eye to the most important elements first.

4. **Recognition Over Recall**  
   - **Example**: Apps that require users to remember commands or codes (recall) instead of providing dropdowns, lists, or autocomplete (recognition) are harder to learn and use.  
   - **Design Tip**: Provide familiar icons, labels, and auto-suggestions. Minimize the user’s need to memorize or type long strings of text.

5. **Mental Models**  
   - **Example**: Many users have a “mental model” that a shopping cart icon in the top right corner will let them view or edit their purchases. Breaking these conventions can create confusion.  
   - **Design Tip**: Match your design with common mental models and established patterns to reduce the learning curve.

### Pre-Class
- **Research**:  
  Read about **human cognitive principles**—cognitive load, memory limits, chunking, and attention—and note how they manifest in everyday applications or websites.
- **Reflect**:  
  Jot down a few cognitive challenges (e.g., too many steps, hidden features, complex forms) you’ve encountered in apps or sites you frequently use.

### In-Class
1. **Lecture**  
   - **Human Cognitive Limits**  
     - Delve deeper into short-term memory capacity and the implications of **“7 ± 2”** (or more recent research suggesting **“4 ± 1”** items).  
     - Discuss how cognitive load can cause users to make errors or abandon tasks.  
     - Emphasize the difference between **recognition** and **recall** in design contexts.
   - **Practical Examples**  
     - Analyze real-world websites/apps known for complexity (e.g., a complicated airline booking website).  
     - Demonstrate where users might be overloaded or forced to remember long confirmation codes and how this impacts task completion.
   - **Design Implications**  
     - Highlight **best practices** that accommodate cognitive limits (e.g., chunking information, using clear labeling, avoiding endless scrolling).

2. **Activities**  
   - **Spot the Overload**: Examine a provided app interface with a cluttered screen.  
     - **Group Discussion**: Identify elements causing high cognitive load (too many buttons, unclear labels, multiple fonts/colors).  
     - **Brainstorm Solutions**: Suggest ways to reduce complexity, such as grouping related tasks or simplifying navigation.
   - **Introduction to Personas**:  
     - Discuss how understanding user goals, behaviors, and cognitive constraints helps tailor the design.

### Post-Class
#### Assignment
1. **Create a Persona**  
   - Develop a user persona for your project that includes demographic details, goals, frustrations, and motivations.  
   - Incorporate potential cognitive challenges this persona might face (e.g., short attention span, limited technology experience, easily overwhelmed by too many choices).

2. **Persona Presentation**  
   - Prepare a brief summary of your persona to share next week. Focus on how this persona’s cognitive characteristics (memory, attention, etc.) will influence your app/website design.
